This is an app for anyone who loves live music! The app allows you to keep track of all of your upcoming live events as well as saves the live events you've previously been to.

## Setup:

First you will need to clone the repository to your termianal.

Once you've cloned create a second tab in your terminal.
`cd` into the `api` and type in

`json-server -p 8088 -w database.json`

In the first tab make sure you are in `main` and type 

`npm install` to install all the dependencies to run the project.

Then type `npm start` and the project should display.
